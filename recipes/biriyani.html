        such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce) and other vegetables, cheese (which may include ricotta and
        parmesan), and
        seasonings and spices such as garlic, oregano and basil.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly,

        <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a
            boil until
            tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>

        <li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on
            top.</li>

        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>

        <li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
